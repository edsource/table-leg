# table-leg

Simple starter template for a Google Spreadsheets-driven project using Tabletop.js I made to save time getting started on similar projects. 

Has a basic page set up with Tabletop.js and wired to [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Gtjc00RaSKo7cYYiYks9yxL7ptwnThH9EYzOvOpVgs/pubhtml), outputting that data using Handlebars.
